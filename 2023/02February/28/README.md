# 28/02

## Update
- Inspired by videos from [Your New Mental Model of constexpr - Jason Turner - CppCon 2021](https://youtu.be/MdrfPSUtMVM?t=11), have tried to produce console presentation slide.
- Finished backend structure and have a minimal template of code that could be extended to add more slides.

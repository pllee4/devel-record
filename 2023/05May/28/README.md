## Update
- While reading more for Lagrangian equation of motion, some mistakes were found during previous application for simple pendulum.
- The damping of the pendulum was previously set to have a logical visual effect without considering the full equation of motion.
- In general, a longer pendulum will have a lower damping constant than a shorter pendulum. This is because the energy of the pendulum is spread out over a larger area, which means that there is less energy available to be absorbed by the damping forces.
- If two pendulums with different length strings are released from the same angle, the pendulum with the shorter string will experience more damping and will stop faster. This is because the shorter pendulum has less energy available to be absorbed by the damping forces. Additionally, the shorter pendulum will have a higher frequency of oscillation, which will also contribute to a faster damping rate.
